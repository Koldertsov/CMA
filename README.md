# CMA
Solving Multi-Agent Path Finding by Constraining Multiple Agents

## Usage
1. Update the path in IO_Manager.java to the location of maps and scenarios.
2. Update the path in RunManager_ExperimentsKRobust.java and RunManager_ExperimentsLA.java.
3. Set maps(folder name), solvers and number of agents (and k parameter for K-Robust) in main.java.
4. Run the code, resuts should appear in users home directory.

## Scenarios
for large agents you shoud specify the size of an agents in the last two columns of .scen file
